This leads to more context-aware, ethically aligned, and medically relevant outputs.\n\nMoreover, we enforce strict encryption, with decryption keys held exclusively in Switzerland. This zero-trust architecture means only the authorized user can read the data – not even we as developers.\n\nThe result: a trusted digital assistant designed for the realities of clinical practice, enabling safe, accurate, and efficient support across the mental healthcare spectrum.",defaultOpen:!1},{id:"3",title:"What do the different AI chat areas mean (therapy, supervision, documentation etc.)?",content:"Each AI area within mentalhealthGPT reflects a distinct clinical use case – supported by purpose-built language models, specifically trained for their tasks:\n\n• **Therapy Support AI** assists in structuring sessions, reflecting on interaction styles, or preparing interventions with clinical empathy and relevance.\n\n• **Supervision & Training** offers role-based dialogue analysis, self-reflection aids, and interactive simulations for continued development.\n\n• **Diagnosis Support** helps structure symptom profiles, compare clinical hypotheses, and draft ICD/DSM-aligned summaries.\n\n• **Audio Transcription & Notes** transforms recorded therapy sessions into accurate, structured notes – including summaries, key moments, and documentation-ready output.\n\n• **Video Analysis** supports movement-, mood-, and interaction-pattern recognition, enabling new insights in multimodal assessments (e.g., child therapy).\n\n• **Documentation & Reporting** streamlines clinical reporting with pre-structured, editable drafts based on real content, aligned with institutional standards.\n\nBy offering separate, specialized assistants, we ensure each AI response is tailored, safe, and clinically valuable – right from the first use.",defaultOpen:!1},{id:"4",title:"How do I know the responses are safe and clinically appropriate?",content:"Unlike general-purpose chatbots, mentalhealthGPT is based on domain-specific language models that are pre-trained on mental health literature, therapeutic frameworks, and real-world clinical cases (anonymized). These models are not only deeply aligned with the language and logic of mental health care, but are also continuously refined by our team of experts – including psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical ethicists.\n\nWe combine this technical foundation with rigorous human-in-the-loop validation and ethical review processes. Every model is monitored and benchmarked against clinical standards to ensure relevance, reliability, and safety. Our goal is to offer professionals a trustworthy AI assistant that speaks their language and understands the nuanced context of mental health work.",defaultOpen:!1},{id:"5",title:"Is mentalhealthGPT available in multiple languages?",content:"Yes, currently we support English, German, and French.

You'll have access to dedicated tools, encrypted data handling, and models that understand the language of your profession.\n\nFor clinics, hospitals, and practices, we offer extended features such as team-based access, shared context models, integration with internal systems, and the ability to train organization-specific expert models. This ensures that your institution’s knowledge, terminology, and care philosophy are reflected in the AI’s responses.\n\nWhether you work alone or in a multidisciplinary team – mentalhealthGPT adapts to your context, helping you deliver consistent, efficient, and privacy-compliant care.",defaultOpen:!1},{id:"7",title:"Can we have our own dedicated mental health AI specialist?",content:"Yes – and that’s one of the most powerful things we offer. We help your clinic, institution, or group practice create its own private mental health AI specialist. This expert is trained using your documentation, therapeutic language, and organizational culture.\n\nThe specialization happens on three levels: institution-wide, for individual departments (such as child & adolescent therapy or bipolar care), and even for complex cases with significant therapy history. This creates an AI that truly understands your professional context – from how you speak to how you work.\n\nUnlike generic chatbots, your AI is aligned with your values, expertise, and standards. It supports your team, enhances consistency, and is constantly improving. For clinics, research labs, and even larger private practices, this means safer, smarter, and more effective digital support — one that becomes a real part of your therapeutic system.",defaultOpen:!1}],E=["Updates","FAQ"];var L=()=>{let e=(0,s.useRouter)();return(0,n.jsx)(r.Z,{hideRightSidebar:!0,children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"p-20 2xl:px-10 md:pt-6 md:px-6 md:pb-10",children:[(0,n.jsx)("button",{className:"hidden absolute top-6 right-6 w-10 h-10 border-2 border-n-4/25 rounded-full text-0 transition-colors hover:border-transparent hover:bg-n-4/25 md:block",onClick:()=>e.back(),children:(0,n.jsx)(o.Z,{className:"fill-n-4",name:"close"})}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"max-w-[58.5rem] mx-auto",children:[(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"mb-4 h2 md:pr-16 md:h3",children:"Updates & FAQ"}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"mb-12 body1 text-n-4 md:mb-6",children:"Features, fixes & improvements."}),(0,n.jsxs)(i.O.Group,{defaultIndex:0,children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.O.List,{className:"mb-12 md:mb-6 space-x-3",children:E.map((e,t)=>(0,n.jsx)(i.O,{className:"h-10 px-6 rounded-full base1 text-n-4 transition-colors outline-none tap-highlight-color hover:text-n-7 ui-selected:bg-primary-1 ui-selected:!text-n-1 dark:hover:text-n-1",children:e},t))}),(0,n.jsxs)(i.O.Panels,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.O.Panel,{children:(0,n.jsx)(S,{items:F})}),(0,n.jsx)(i.O.Panel,{children:(0,n.jsx)(z,{items:C})})]})]})]})]})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[138,193,957,470,696,968,535,971,23,744],function(){return e(e.s=273)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
