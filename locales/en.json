  "Unlike general-purpose chatbots, mentalhealthGPT is based on domain-specific language models that are pre-trained on mental health literature, therapeutic frameworks, and real-world clinical cases (anonymized). These models are not only deeply aligned with the language and logic of mental health care, but are also continuously refined by our team of experts ‚Äì including psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical ethicists. We combine this technical foundation with rigorous human-in-the-loop validation and ethical review processes. Every model is monitored and benchmarked against clinical standards to ensure relevance, reliability, and safety.
