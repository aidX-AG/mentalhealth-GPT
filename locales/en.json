By contributing early (e.g., €90/CHF90 for the first year), you get full access to all new features as they’re released — including transcription, documentation, and domain-specific AI assistants. As a thank-you, your second year will be free. Founding Members are more than users: they help shape the roadmap and can actively provide feedback. It’s ideal for professionals and institutions who want to be part of something transformative from the very beginning.":{"string":"The Founding Membership is a one-time opportunity to support the early development of mentalhealthGPT and gain exclusive access and benefits.
