While platforms like ChatGPT or DeepSeek offer powerful language capabilities, they are not tailored for clinical accuracy, therapeutic tone, or privacy-critical environments. mentalhealthGPT uses specialized AI models that have been fine-tuned on mental health contexts ‚Äì including psychotherapy, diagnostics, patient communication, research workflows, and administrative tasks. This leads to more context-aware, ethically aligned, and medically relevant outputs. Moreover, we enforce strict encryption, with decryption keys held exclusively in Switzerland. This zero-trust architecture means only the authorized user can read the data ‚Äì not even we as developers. The result: a trusted digital assistant designed for the realities of clinical practice, enabling safe, accurate, and efficient support across the mental healthcare spectrum."
