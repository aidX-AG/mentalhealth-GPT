                        Our AI can securely transcribe audio recordings from therapy sessions, structure the content,
                        and generate clear, professional summaries â€” all with end-to-end encryption.
                        <br />
                        Simply upload a recorded session. All patient information remains strictly confidential and is protected 
                        by strong encryption directly in your browser, during transfer, and back again â€” ensuring full privacy at every step.
